# literatura
# An app designed to help users learn about various works of literature, specifically those canon to quizbowl.
# The ultimate goal is for users to be interested andd inspired by the quizzes and hopefully read the works themselves.
# The quiz portion is based off a tutorial by Victor Wooding on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g1_UH_6VQc
# The book searching portion is based off a tutorial by Roger Hu, involving the OpenLibrary API: https://guides.codepath.com/android/Book-Search-Tutorial#adding-a-detail-view
# The questions are edited based off of a quizbowl study guide by Kevin Kodama. Thanks Kevin!
