# literatura
An app designed to help users learn about various works of literature, specifically those canon to quizbowl.
The ultimate goal is for users to gain interest and inspiration from the quizzes, hopefully resulting in reading the works themselves.

The quiz portion is based off a [tutorial by Victor Wooding on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g1_UH_6VQc).
The book searching portion is based off a [tutorial by Roger Hu](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Book-Search-Tutorial), involving the OpenLibrary API. 

The questions are edited based off of a quizbowl study guide by Kevin Kodama. 

Check the prototype on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/PhUbHgJ28HrCGJ9CuN9esmfL/literatura?node-id=24%3A241&scaling=scale-down)!
